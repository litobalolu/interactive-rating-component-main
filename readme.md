## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
-Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

-Found out for the first time that HTML has a disable attribute for butttons(though I didnt use it).
- I did my first Javascript project without videos or blog posts(though stack overflow and google was my friend throughout my journey ;) )

### Continued development

- For this project, I'd want to add more functionality in the nearest future, some of which are:
1: A "go back button" that allows you go back to the 'Ratings page' from the 'Thank you' page.
1: A reset button that clears the selected rating number and refreshes the page.
3: An option to meet your selected number after you go back from 1(one) above. And many more.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This helped me. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.google.com) - I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
